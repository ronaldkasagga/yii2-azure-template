REQUIREMENTS
------------

The minimum requirement by this project template that your Web server supports PHP 5.4.0.


INSTALLATION
------------

### Install via Composer

If you do not have [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/), you may install it by following the instructions
at [getcomposer.org](http://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-nix).

You can then install this project template using the following command:

~~~
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.2.0"
php composer.phar create-project --prefer-dist --stability=dev yiisoft/yii2-app-basic basic
~~~

Now you should be able to access the application through the following URL, assuming `basic` is the directory
directly under the Web root.

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


### Install from an Archive File

Extract the archive file downloaded from [yiiframework.com](http://www.yiiframework.com/download/) to
a directory named `basic` that is directly under the Web root.

Set cookie validation key in `config/web.php` file to some random secret string:

```php
'request' => [
    // !!! insert a secret key in the following (if it is empty) - this is required by cookie validation
    'cookieValidationKey' => '<secret random string goes here>',
],
```

You can then access the application through the following URL:

~~~
http://localhost/basic/web/
~~~


CONFIGURATION
-------------

### Entry Script

The entry script /web/index.php was removed to allow for disabling debug modules that 
don't load on production. Use the following scripts accordingly

#### Development

Place this script inside `/web/index.php`

```php
defined('YII_DEBUG') or define('YII_DEBUG', true);
defined('YII_ENV') or define('YII_ENV', 'dev');

require(__DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php');
require(__DIR__ . '/../vendor/yiisoft/yii2/Yii.php');

$config = require(__DIR__ . '/../config/web.php');

(new yii\web\Application($config))->run();
```

#### On Azure
* Go to the Kodu Debug console of your app (https://<app name>.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole
* Navigate to the path `\home\site\wwwroot\web\` and create an `index.php`
* Paste the content below into `index.php` and save

```php
require(__DIR__ . '/../vendor/autoload.php');
require(__DIR__ . '/../vendor/yiisoft/yii2/Yii.php');

$config = require(__DIR__ . '/../config/web.php');

(new yii\web\Application($config))->run();
```

### Database

#### For Production
Edit the file `config/db.php` with real data to match the environment variables
with the database credentials
```php
// previous code here . . . 
if(containsAllKeys($_ENV, ['MY_PROJECT_DB_DSN', 'MY_PROJECT_DB_USER', 'MY_PROJECT_DB_PASSWORD'])){
    $dsn = $_ENV['MY_PROJECT_DB_DSN'];
    $username = $_ENV['MY_PROJECT_DB_USER'];
    $password = $_ENV['MY_PROJECT_DB_PASSWORD'];
}
//and so on . . . .
```
On your web dashboard on the azure portal, go to **SETTINGS >> Application Settings** and set the  
values of _'MY_PROJECT_DB_DSN', 'MY_PROJECT_DB_USER', 'MY_PROJECT_DB_PASSWORD'_ above accordingly, under 
**App Settings**

#### For Development 
You could as well use the approach above (set the environment variables _'MY_PROJECT_DB_DSN', 'MY_PROJECT_DB_USER', 'MY_PROJECT_DB_PASSWORD'_)
or you could create `/config/db_local.php` and set your development database credentials, such as
```php
return [
    'dsn' => 'mysql:host=localhost;dbname=yii2basic',
    'username' => 'root',
    'password' => '',
];
```

### Azure Portal Configuration
#### Setting the Directory Root
 * On the web app's portal, go to SETTINGS >> Application Settings
 * Scroll down to 'Virtual applications and directories'
 * Change the physical path to 'site\wwwroot\web' and Save
  
#### Dependencies
* Go to the debug console (https:://<appname>.scm.azurewebsites.net/DebugConsole)
* Change directory on the console to `wwwroot`
* Run the following commands
```bash
php composer.phar global require "fxp/composer-asset-plugin:^1.2.0"
php composer.phar install #will take a while
php composer.phar update #optional to make sure everything works
```
You might exceed your GitHub rate limit and be asked to obtain a token for the update process

**NOTES:**
- Yii won't create the database for you, this has to be done manually before you can access it.
- Check and edit the other files in the `config/` directory to customize your application as required.
- Refer to the README in the `tests` directory for information specific to basic application tests.



TESTING
-------

Tests are located in `tests` directory. They are developed with [Codeception PHP Testing Framework](http://codeception.com/).
By default there are 3 test suites:

- `unit`
- `functional`
- `acceptance`

Tests can be executed by running

```
composer exec codecept run
``` 

The command above will execute unit and functional tests. Unit tests are testing the system components, while functional
tests are for testing user interaction. Acceptance tests are disabled by default as they require additional setup since
they perform testing in real browser. 


### Running  acceptance tests

To execute acceptance tests do the following:  

1. Rename `tests/acceptance.suite.yml.example` to `tests/acceptance.suite.yml` to enable suite configuration

2. Replace `codeception/base` package in `composer.json` with `codeception/codeception` to install full featured
   version of Codeception

3. Update dependencies with Composer 

    ```
    composer update  
    ```

4. Download [Selenium Server](http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/) and launch it:

    ```
    java -jar ~/selenium-server-standalone-x.xx.x.jar
    ``` 

5. (Optional) Create `yii2_basic_tests` database and update it by applying migrations if you have them.

   ```
   tests/bin/yii migrate
   ```

   The database configuration can be found at `config/test_db.php`.


6. Start web server:

    ```
    tests/bin/yii serve
    ```

7. Now you can run all available tests

   ```
   # run all available tests
   composer exec codecept run

   # run acceptance tests
   composer exec codecept run acceptance

   # run only unit and functional tests
   composer exec codecept run unit,functional
   ```

### Code coverage support

By default, code coverage is disabled in `codeception.yml` configuration file, you should uncomment needed rows to be able
to collect code coverage. You can run your tests and collect coverage with the following command:

```
#collect coverage for all tests
composer exec codecept run -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage only for unit tests
composer exec codecept run unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml

#collect coverage for unit and functional tests
composer exec codecept run functional,unit -- --coverage-html --coverage-xml
```

You can see code coverage output under the `tests/_output` directory.
